## üë©‚Äçüíª Challenge and playground

The challenge is simple: You must create a software that interacts with Get on Board data through its [public or private APIs](https://api-doc.getonbrd.com/).

It can be a web or mobile app, a service, a bot, a game, or anything that plays with the data and possibilities offered by our API, as well as data or information from other public sources.

**The sky and your imagination are the only limits.**

## üõ† Tools, languages, frameworks, or libraries allowed.

Everything is allowed in this world. There are no restrictions whatsoever. You can use low-code or no-code tools if you want. The most important thing is that it works and that it can be used!

## üìÉ Documentation and help

### API

The scope and documentation on how to interact with the API can be found on the website [http://api-doc.getonbrd.com/](http://api-doc.getonbrd.com/).

### The hackathon is 100% virtual and will take place on our Discord server.

We will be answering questions on the Get on Board Discord server. You and your team can join at [http://www.awesomefest.co/discord](http://www.awesomefest.co/discord).

Note: Registered teams will receive support from the mentors directly on their private channels.

Unregistered people or teams who still want to participate in the challenge, can post their questions in the open channel #awesome-fest.

## üìê Rules

Nothing complicated:

- Your application code must be a public repository on Github.
- The repository must include the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in this repository
- Include a [README.md](http://readme.md/) explaining what your solution is about and instructions to run it if applicable
- Include a link to a 1-minute demonstration video
- Half-baked solutions or solutions that do not work will be discarded immediately.

### Github repository

Create a repository (which should be public on the day of submission) on GitHub with your solution. We recommend that you also use it as part of the development so that everyone in the team can collaborate.

For no-code or low-code solutions include only the README.

### License

The license cannot be other than the one included in this repository, so you must copy the file without modification (except the copyright).

### Documentation of the solution

Explain what your solution does, add screenshots and a link **public** to a demonstrative video.

### Video

The video should be publicly accessible and no longer than 1 minute, so choose and show the best features of your solution.

## ‚úÖ Evaluation

Solutions will be assessed using the following dimensions:

1. Functionality

1. Originality

1. UX/UI

1. Complexity

1. Added value

## üí° Tips

- Avoid including - since the repositories will be public - sensitive or private information such as tokens or secret access keys.
- In case you are a remote team, use a video conferencing solution that allows you to share a screen and especially to control someone's screen in order to collaborate in a more agile way.
- Pair programming when you are trying to solve something complicated, just as in chess the outsider always sees more.
- Ask for help in Discord in case you are stuck, there will always be someone there to solve questions.
- Subscribe to this repository (Watch button at the top right) to find out about new FAQs.

## ‚ùî FAQ

Questions of public interest asked by the teams in Discord will be added here, so we recommend you to subscribe to this repository to find out the latest updates.
